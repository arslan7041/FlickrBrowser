# FlickrBrowser
Android App that uses the Flickr API to browse through images on flickr. Users can search for images by entering tags into a search bar.

If multiple tags are entered, they must be comma separated. Long-clicking on a particular image will open it in larger view on a new screen while displaying its title, author, as well as all the tags associated with it.
